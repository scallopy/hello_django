	<p>The GPS project was launched by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1973 for use by 
	the United States military and became fully operational in 1995. It was allowed 
	for civilian use in the 1980s.</p> 
	
	{% endblocktrans %}
	{% blocktrans %}
	
	<p>The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently 
	of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the 
	usefulness of the GPS positioning information. The GPS provides critical positioning 
	capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. The United 
	States government created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible 
	to anyone with a GPS receiver.</p>
	
	{% endblocktrans %}
	{% blocktrans %}
	
	<p>It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time 
	information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an 
	unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites ( to obtain an accurate 
	result for the position of the receiver ).</p> 
	
	{% endblocktrans %}
	{% blocktrans %}
	
	<p>Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special 
	cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position 
	using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. 
	Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last 
	known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from 
	the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four 
	satellites are visible.</p>
	
	{% endblocktrans %}
	{% blocktrans %}
	
	<p>The current GPS consists of three major segments. These are the space segment, a 
	control segment, and a user segment. The U.S. Air Force develops, maintains, and 
	operates the space and control segments. GPS satellites broadcast signals from space, 
	and each GPS receiver uses these signals to calculate its three-dimensional location 
	(latitude, longitude, and altitude) and the current time.</p>

	<h3>Many civilian applications use one or more of GPS's three basic components: absolute 
	location, relative movement, and time transfer:</h3>
		
	{% endblocktrans %}
	<ul>
		{% blocktrans %}
	
		<li>Agriculture:  Today, a growing number of crop producers are using GPS and other modern 
		electronic and computer equipment to practice Site-Specific Management (SSM) and 
		precision agriculture. This technology has the potential in agricultural mechanization 
		(farm and machinery management) by providing farmers with a sophisticated tool to 
		measure yield on much smaller scales as well as precise determination and automatic 
		storing of variables such as field time, working area, machine travel distance and 
		speed, fuel consumption and yield information.</li></br>
		
		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}
	
		<li>Vehicles: location and routes for cars and trucks.</li></br>
		
		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}

		<li>Cartography: both civilian and military cartographers use GPS extensively.</li></br>
		
		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}

		<li>Cellular Telephony: Mobile telephony is the provision of telephone services to phones 
		which may move around freely rather than stay fixed in one location. Mobile phones 
		connect to a terrestrial cellular network of base stations (cell sites), whereas 
		satellite phones connect to orbiting satellites. Both networks are interconnected 
		to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to allow any phone in the world to 
		be dialed.</li></br>
	
		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}
		
		<li>Clock synchronization: the accuracy of GPS time signals (Â±10 ns)[88] is second only 
		to the atomic clocks they are based on, and is used in applications such as GPS 
		disciplined oscillators.</li></br>

		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}
	
		<li>Fleet tracking: used to identify, locate and maintain contact reports with one or more 
		fleet vehicles in real-time.</li></br>

		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}
	
		<li>Vehicle tracking systems, person tracking systems, and pet tracking systems use GPS to 
		locate devices that are attached to or carried by a person, vehicle, or pet. This can 
		provide continuous tracking and send notifications.</li></br>

		{% endblocktrans %}
		{% blocktrans %}
	
		<li>Navigation: navigators value digitally precise velocity and orientation measurements.</li></br>
		{% endblocktrans %}
	
		{% blocktrans %}
		<li>Telematics: GPS technology integrated with computers and mobile communications 
		technology in automotive navigation systems.</li></br>
		{% endblocktrans %}
